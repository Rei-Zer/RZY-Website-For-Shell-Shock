        <h3>How I taught Shell Shock to climb walls.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I built him a house and left the top open. First, i propped him up and helped his 2 front legs onto the magnet tile, then i pushed his 
          backlegs up and when they got onto the top of the tiles, he pushed himself over. I slowly stopped helping him and by now, he can climb it all by himself!
        </p>

        <p>This skill came in handy when the strong winds slanted his platform. It wasn't a problem for him though!</p>

                <p>I realised that sometimes when Shell Shock fell over, it was hard for him to flip himself over when he wasn't in water. So i decided to train him.
                  I waited until he accidentally flipped himself over which happened quite often when he was climbing and fell, then he used his head and tried to flip himself over but failed.
                  So, I gently pushed him a little to give him enough momentum to flip himself over. After that, i took his back leg and pushed it gently on the ground,
                  to give him even more momentum. It took a couple of tries but he got it in the end. After a while, he could do it within one try. I was so 
                  proud of him.

          <div id="malay-anthem-body" class="collapse">
            <p>I trained Shell Shock to eat from my hand by getting him to regonise my hand first.
              When I first started training him, whenever he bit my hand he would not let go as he thought it was food.
              However, after spending a long long time with him, he could tell the difference between me and food.
              Now, if he accidentally bites me he will let go immediately. He is also older and knows his bites can hurt.
              He confirmed it when my friend tried feeding him by hand. I mean, I warned him Shell Shock would
              not know he wasn't food as he did not know who my friend was or might think he was a predator.

      <div><h3>Info</h3>
      <p>What they look like: Red-eared Sliders are brightly marked, and look a lot like the Western Painted turtles. One difference between the two is it's top shell (carapace - prounounced CARE-a-pace). The Red-eared Slider's carapace looks like a bowl turned upside down while the Painted turtle is flatter. [ see comparison guide ]

        There are other distinguishing marks. The shell is divided into "scutes" - they look like separate plates stuck together to form the shell. The scutes along the outside edge of the carapace are outlined in yellow. There is alos red ear mark located just behind the eye.
        
        The head, neck, and legs are greenish with yellow stripes. The plastron (bottom shell) is yellow with a dark, rounded blotch in each scute.
        
        Males are slightly smaller than females and have longer claws on their front feet. Old turtles, especially males, may become very dark and almost look black all over
        Adult Carapace Length: 5 to 11 inches (12.5 to 27.9 cm).</p>
        <p>Diet: Red-eared Sliders feed mainly on plants and small animals, such as crickets, fish, crayfish, snails, tadpoles, worms, aquatic insects and aquatic plants. Turtles don't have teeth, but instead have spiky ridges that have little sharp groves, like a serrated knife on their upper and lower jaws.</p>
